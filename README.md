# Speed-Dating-Predictor

Welcome to our speed-dating predictor page! We used a random forest decision tree classifier, cross-validated with an XGB classifier to attempt to predict if two individuals would go on a second date with each other. 

The code is divided into two main sections: 
1. Cleaning
- 1 main file 'data_cleaner.py' that was run to clean and pre-process the data
2. Modelling 
- 'processor.py' runs dimension reduction techniques and generates plots to explore the data
- 'PROJECT_MODEL.ipynb' is where the bulk of the decision tree modelling  is done
